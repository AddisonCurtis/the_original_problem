    "- In 1952 [Donald A. Glaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Glaser) invented a new tool for studying partical physics - the **[bubble chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber)**. \n",
    "    - Glaser was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1960 for his invention.\n",
    "- The bubble chamber worked by tracing the bubbles formed by charged particles moving through a superheated liquid. \n",
    "- Physicist took pictures of the bubbles as particles moved through the chamber using multiple cameras mounted around the bubble chamber.\n",
    "- By analyzing the the radius of curvature of the bubbles, physicist could infer the momentum of individual particles.\n",
    "- Bubble chambers and the data they produce have allowed physicist to make some pretty incredible discoveries, such as **weak neutral currents** - [Nice video from 60 symbols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=basLNz6frO8)"
